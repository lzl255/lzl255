Hi I'm Zili Luo but please call me Leslie (LESLIE stands for LESLIE's Exclusive Solutions for Locally Integrated Electronics).

This is my account for uni work, my normal account is [leslie255](https://github.com/leslie255).

I have a few projects on my other accuont
- [leslie255/**emu6502**](https://github.com/leslie255/emu6502): Commodore 6502 CPU emulator (C)
- [leslie255/**sharklang**](https://github.com/leslie255/sharklang): Compiler for a custom designed language (Rust, WIP, works)

If you're one my of the people from the class feel free to ask me any questions, it could be about C or assembly or just programming in general, I'm like pretty good at this shit.
