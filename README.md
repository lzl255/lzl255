Hi I'm Zili Luo but please call me Leslie (LESLIE stands for LESLIE's Exclusive Solutions for Locally Integrated Electronics).

This is my alt for my uni works, my main is [leslie255](https://github.com/leslie255).

I have a few notable projects on my main:
- [leslie255/**emu6502**](https://github.com/leslie255/emu6502): Commodore 6502 CPU emulator (C)
- [leslie255/**sharklang**](https://github.com/leslie255/sharklang): Compiler for a custom designed language (Rust, WIP, works)
- [leslie255/**lmcc**](https://github.com/leslie255/lmcc): C compiler (Rust, WIP, does not work)

If you're from my class feel free to ask me for help, it could be about C or assembly or just programming in general, I'm like pretty good at this shit lol.

Contact me through email ([iam@luozi.li](mailto:iam@luozi.li)) or Discord (@kerbal_255).
